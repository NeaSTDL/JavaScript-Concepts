# Assignment Types in JavaScript

Assignment in JavaScript is the process of storing a value in a variable. JavaScript provides several assignment operators, each with its own use case and behavior.

## 1. Simple Assignment
Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
```js
let x = 10;
const name = "Alex";
```

## 2. Compound Assignment Operators
Combine an arithmetic operation with assignment.
| Operator | Example   | Equivalent         |
|----------|-----------|--------------------|
| +=       | x += 2    | x = x + 2          |
| -=       | x -= 2    | x = x - 2          |
| *=       | x *= 2    | x = x * 2          |
| /=       | x /= 2    | x = x / 2          |
| %=       | x %= 2    | x = x % 2          |
| **=      | x **= 2   | x = x ** 2         |
```
let y = 5;
y += 3; // 8
y *= 2; // 16
```

## 3. Bitwise Assignment Operators
Operate on the binary representation of numbers.
| Operator | Example   | Equivalent         |
|----------|-----------|--------------------|
| &=       | x &= 2    | x = x & 2          |
| \|=      | x |= 2    | x = x | 2          |
| ^=       | x ^= 2    | x = x ^ 2          |
| <<=      | x <<= 2   | x = x << 2         |
| >>=      | x >>= 2   | x = x >> 2         |
| >>>=     | x >>>= 2  | x = x >>> 2        |
```
let z = 7;
z &= 3; // 3
z |= 8; // 11
```

## 4. Destructuring Assignment
Allows unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
### Array Destructuring
```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const [a, b, c] = arr;
// a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
```
### Object Destructuring
```js
const user = { name: "Sam", age: 25 };
const { name, age } = user;
// name = "Sam", age = 25
```

## 5. Default Assignment in Destructuring
You can provide default values when destructuring.
```js
const [x = 10, y = 20] = [5];
// x = 5, y = 20
```

## 6. Chained Assignment
Assign the same value to multiple variables in a single statement.
```js
let a, b, c;
a = b = c = 100;
// All variables are now 100
```

## 7. Logical Assignment Operators
Logical assignment operators combine logical operations with assignment. They are useful for setting default values or updating variables only if a condition is met.

| Operator | Example         | Equivalent                |
|----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| \|\|=    | x \|\|= y      | x = x \|\| y              |
| &&=      | x &&= y        | x = x && y                |
| ??=      | x ??= y        | x = x ?? y                |

### Examples
```js
let a = 0;
a ||= 5; // a is 5 (0 is falsy)

let b = 10;
b &&= 20; // b is 20 (10 is truthy)

let c = null;
c ??= 'default'; // c is 'default' (nullish)
```

## Summary
Assignment types in JavaScript range from simple value assignment to advanced destructuring and bitwise operations. Mastering these helps write concise and powerful code.
