# Reserved Words in JavaScript

Reserved words are identifiers that have special meaning in JavaScript and cannot be used as variable, function, or class names. They are part of the language syntax and help define the structure and behavior of the language.

## What are Reserved Words?
Reserved words are keywords that are reserved by the JavaScript language for its own use. Attempting to use them as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.) will result in a syntax error.

## Categories of Reserved Words

### 1. ECMAScript Language Keywords
These are used to define the structure and flow of JavaScript programs:
```
break, case, catch, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, else, export, extends, finally, for, function, if, import, in, instanceof, let, new, return, super, switch, this, throw, try, typeof, var, void, while, with, yield
```

### 2. Future Reserved Words
Reserved for possible future extensions to the language:
```
enum, implements, interface, package, private, protected, public, static, await
```

### 3. Strict Mode Reserved Words
Some words are only reserved in strict mode:
```
implements, interface, let, package, private, protected, public, static, yield
```

### 4. Literals
These are also reserved and cannot be used as identifiers:
```
null, true, false
```

## Notes
- Using reserved words as identifiers will result in a syntax error.
- Some words are only reserved in strict mode (e.g., `let`, `static`).
- Reserved words may differ slightly between ECMAScript versions.
- Browsers may have additional reserved words for compatibility.

## Example: Syntax Error
```js
// let class = 5; // SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'class'
// function return() {} // SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'return'
```

## Complete List (ECMAScript 2023)
For the most up-to-date list, see the [ECMAScript specification](https://262.ecma-international.org/14.0/#sec-keywords).

## Summary
Always avoid using reserved words as variable, function, or class names to prevent errors and ensure your code is valid and future-proof.
