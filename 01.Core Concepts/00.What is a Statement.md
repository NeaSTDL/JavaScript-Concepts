# What are Statements in JavaScript?

A **statement** in JavaScript is a command that instructs the JavaScript engine to perform an action. Statements are the building blocks of any JavaScript program and are executed in sequence, unless control flow statements dictate otherwise.

## Key Points
- Statements are executed one after another, top to bottom.
- Each statement usually ends with a semicolon (`;`), though JavaScript uses automatic semicolon insertion (ASI) if omitted.
- A program is a sequence of statements.

## Types of Statements

### 1. Declaration Statements
Used to declare variables, functions, or classes.
```js
let x = 5;
const name = "Alex";
function greet() { return "Hello!"; }
class Person {}
```

### 2. Expression Statements
Evaluate an expression and produce a value.
```js
x = x + 1;
console.log(name);
```

### 3. Control Flow Statements
Change the order in which statements are executed.
- **Conditional**: `if`, `else`, `switch`
- **Loops**: `for`, `while`, `do...while`, `for...of`, `for...in`
- **Jump**: `break`, `continue`, `return`, `throw`
```js
if (x > 0) {
  console.log("Positive");
} else {
  console.log("Non-positive");
}

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

### 4. Block Statements
Group zero or more statements together using curly braces `{}`.
```js
{
  let y = 10;
  console.log(y);
}
```

### 5. Empty Statement
A single semicolon (`;`) is a valid statement that does nothing.
```js
;
```

## Statement vs. Expression
- **Statement**: Performs an action.
- **Expression**: Produces a value.

Some statements can contain expressions, but not all expressions are statements.

## Example Program
```js
let a = 2;           // Declaration statement
if (a > 1) {         // Control flow statement
  a = a * 3;         // Expression statement
}
console.log(a);      // Expression statement
```

## Summary
Statements are the fundamental instructions in JavaScript, forming the structure and flow of every program.
