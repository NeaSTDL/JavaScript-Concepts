# Object Oriented Concepts
## JavaScript Prototypes

Prototypes are a core concept in JavaScript and form the foundation of its object-oriented capabilities. Understanding prototypes is essential for mastering inheritance, property lookup, and the behavior of objects in JavaScript.

## What is a Prototype?
A prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties and methods. Every JavaScript object has an internal link to its prototype, accessible via `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` or the deprecated `__proto__` property.

## How Prototypal Inheritance Works
When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for it on the object itself. If not found, it searches up the prototype chain until it finds the property or reaches the end of the chain (usually `Object.prototype`).

## Setting the Prototype of an Object
You can set the prototype of an object using `Object.setPrototypeOf()` or by creating an object with a specific prototype using `Object.create()`.
```js
const animal = {
  speak() { console.log('Animal speaks'); }
};
const dog = Object.create(animal);
dog.speak(); // 'Animal speaks'
```

## Example: setPrototypeOf
```js
let networkNode = {
  subnet: '192.168.0.0',
  mask: '255.255.255.0',
  ip: '192.168.0.1'
};
let myPc = {};
Object.setPrototypeOf(myPc, networkNode);
console.log(myPc.ip); // '192.168.0.1'
```

## Checking the Prototype of an Object
Use `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` to retrieve an object's prototype. The `__proto__` property is also available but deprecated.
```js
const myObject = {};
const proto = Object.getPrototypeOf(myObject);
console.log(typeof proto); // 'object'
```

## Property Lookup and Inheritance
- If a property is not found on the object, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain.
- Properties are not copied; they are referenced via the chain.
- Use `hasOwnProperty()` to check if a property exists directly on the object.
```js
let Person = { age: 18 };
let Jimmy = {};
Object.setPrototypeOf(Jimmy, Person);
console.log(Person.hasOwnProperty('age')); // true
console.log(Jimmy.hasOwnProperty('age')); // false
console.log(Jimmy.age); // 18 (inherited)
```

## Default Prototype
All objects in JavaScript have a prototype by default. For objects created with `{}`, the prototype is `Object.prototype`.

## Prototype Chaining
Objects can inherit from other objects, forming a chain. This is called prototype chaining.
```js
let Person = { firstName: '', lastName: '', age: 0 };
let Student = {
  enrolledCourses: [],
  enroll(course) { this.enrolledCourses.push(course); }
};
let Tim = { firstName: 'Tim', lastName: 'Cook', age: 18 };
Object.setPrototypeOf(Tim, Student);
Object.setPrototypeOf(Student, Person);
Tim.enroll('CS101');
console.log(Tim.firstName); // 'Tim'
console.log(Tim.enrolledCourses); // ['CS101']
```

## Modifying Prototypes
You can add or change properties and methods on a prototype, and all objects inheriting from it will see the change.
```js
Person.sayHello = function() { console.log('Hello!'); };
Tim.sayHello(); // 'Hello!'
```

## Prototype vs. __proto__ vs. prototype Property
- `__proto__`: The actual prototype of the object (deprecated, but widely supported).
- `prototype`: A property of constructor functions used when creating new objects with `new`.
- `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)`: The standard way to get an object's prototype.

## Best Practices
- Prefer `Object.create()` for creating objects with a specific prototype.
- Avoid modifying built-in prototypes (like `Array.prototype`).
- Use `hasOwnProperty()` to distinguish own properties from inherited ones.

## Summary
Prototypes enable inheritance and code reuse in JavaScript. Mastering prototypes is key to understanding how objects and inheritance work in the language.
