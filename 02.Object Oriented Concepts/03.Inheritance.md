# Object Oriented Concepts
## Inheritance with Constructor Functions

Inheritance allows you to create new objects based on existing ones, promoting code reuse and logical hierarchies. In JavaScript, inheritance is achieved through prototypes, and constructor functions are a classic way to implement it.

## Why Use Inheritance?
- Share common functionality between related objects
- Avoid code duplication
- Model real-world relationships (e.g., Person → Student)

## Basic Inheritance Pattern
To set up inheritance between constructor functions, follow these steps:

### 1. Define the Parent Constructor
```js
function Person(firstName, lastName, age) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
  this.age = age;
}
Person.prototype.isAdult = function() {
  return this.age >= 18;
};
```

### 2. Define the Child Constructor
```js
function Student(firstName, lastName, age) {
  // Call the parent constructor with the child's context
  Person.call(this, firstName, lastName, age);
  this.courses = [];
}
```

### 3. Set Up the Prototype Chain
```js
Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Student.prototype.constructor = Student;
```
- This ensures that `Student` inherits from `Person` and that `instanceof` works correctly.

### 4. Add Child-Specific Methods
```js
Student.prototype.enroll = function(course) {
  this.courses.push(course);
};
```

## Example: Using the Inheritance Chain
```js
let jim = new Student('Jim', 'Root', 40);
console.log(jim instanceof Student); // true
console.log(jim instanceof Person); // true
jim.enroll('Math');
console.log(jim.courses); // ['Math']
```

## Polymorphism and Method Overriding
Polymorphism allows child objects to override parent methods.
```js
Person.prototype.getRole = function() {
  return 'Person';
};
Student.prototype.getRole = function() {
  return 'Student';
};
console.log(jim.getRole()); // 'Student'
```

## Abstract Methods (Simulated)
JavaScript does not have true abstract methods, but you can simulate them by throwing errors in the parent prototype:
```js
Person.prototype.isAdult = function() {
  throw new Error('isAdult() must be implemented by subclass');
};
Student.prototype.isAdult = function() {
  return this.age >= 18;
};
```

## Inheritance Best Practices
- Always reset the child prototype's constructor to itself after using `Object.create`.
- Use `call` to invoke the parent constructor for property initialization.
- Use `Object.create` for prototype chaining, not direct assignment.
- Override methods in the child prototype for polymorphism.

## Summary
Inheritance with constructor functions and prototypes is a powerful way to share functionality and create hierarchies in JavaScript. Mastering these patterns is essential for advanced object-oriented programming in the language.
