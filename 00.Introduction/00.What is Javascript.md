# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and has since become the standard scripting language for web development.

## Key Characteristics
- **Interpreted**: JavaScript code is executed line by line by the browser or runtime environment, rather than being compiled ahead of time.
- **Dynamically Typed**: Variables do not require a fixed type and can hold any data type at runtime.
- **Prototype-based**: Inheritance and object creation are handled through prototypes rather than classical classes (though ES6 introduced class syntax).
- **Multi-paradigm**: Supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
- **Event-driven**: Especially in browsers, JavaScript responds to user actions and events.
- **Single-threaded with Event Loop**: Executes code in a single thread but can handle asynchronous operations via callbacks, promises, and async/await.

## Where Does JavaScript Run?
- **Web Browsers**: All modern browsers have built-in JavaScript engines (e.g., V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox).
- **Servers**: With environments like Node.js, JavaScript can run on the server side.
- **Other Platforms**: JavaScript can be embedded in desktop and mobile apps, IoT devices, and more.

## Evolution
- **ECMAScript**: JavaScript is standardized under the ECMAScript specification (ECMA-262). Major updates (ES5, ES6/ES2015, etc.) have added new features and syntax.

## Example
```js
console.log('Hello, JavaScript!');
```

## Summary
JavaScript is essential for creating interactive, dynamic web applications and is now used across the entire software stack, from client to server and beyond.
